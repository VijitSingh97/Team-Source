# Gatsby Material UI Business Starter

**[Check out the demo.](https://bluepeter.github.io/gatsby-material-ui-business-starter/)**

Stripped-down Gatsby small business starter that uses the well-maintained and
beautiful [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) React.js project. Fully
configured to reliably work with this powerful library out-of-the-box, in PROD,
and in DEV with hot-reloading.

- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/): the world's most popular Material
  Design React.js framework
- [Stylus for CSS](http://stylus-lang.com/)
- [Material Design icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/)
- Relatively bare: we don't burden the project with a lot of complex hoopla

For something a bit simpler that also uses Material UI, check out our [Tiny
Agency starter](https://github.com/foxandgeese/tiny-agency).

## Structure

- Edit contact detail and menu items in
  [`gatsby-config.json`](https://github.com/bluepeter/gatsby-material-ui-business-starter/blob/master/gatsby-config.js).
- Want to add a new product? Just add a new markdown file in
  [`products`](https://github.com/bluepeter/gatsby-material-ui-business-starter/tree/master/src/pages/products)
  and it will automatically be included.

### Styling

You can use CSS in two different ways:

- Edit the Stylus file
  [`style.styl`](https://github.com/bluepeter/gatsby-material-ui-business-starter/blob/master/src/css/style.styl)
  directly to add classes/etc. You can then adjust components to use these
  classes.
- Use Material UI's `withStyles()` to override and dynamically set classes from
  within each component. For an example of how to do this, please see
  [`HomeFeatures.js`](https://github.com/bluepeter/gatsby-material-ui-business-starter/blob/master/src/components/HomeFeatures.js),
  including getting and using theme colors.

You can adjust the theme palette colors in
[`getPageContext.js`](https://github.com/bluepeter/gatsby-material-ui-business-starter/blob/master/src/utils/getPageContext.js).

## Deployment

```
yarn
```

To build, watch for file edits and hot-reload, and run locally:

```
